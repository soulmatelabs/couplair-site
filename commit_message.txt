feat: add installation guides and support section

Added dedicated installation guide pages for iOS and Android, enhanced the UI with animations, and restructured the footer for better support discoverability.

What:
- Introduced `iOSInstallGuide` and `AndroidInstallGuide` pages and components.
- Integrated `framer-motion` for modal and footer animations.
- Restructured the site footer to include a new "Support" section.
- Added a "Professional Advice" disclaimer to the Terms of Service.

How:
- Created multi-phase installation components for both platforms.
- Updated `App.jsx` with new routes and `package.json` with motion dependencies.
- Refactored `DownloadModal` to include animated transitions and guide links.
- Corrected file casing for iOS-related assets to ensure cross-platform compatibility.

Why:
To provide a clear path for beta testers to install the application and to centralize support resources for improved user onboarding and legal clarity.
