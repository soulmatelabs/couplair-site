feat: improve interactions and optimize assets

Refactored site navigation and UI components for better performance and user experience.

- Navigation: Updated the "Get the App" button in the header to open the DownloadModal directly using local state instead of a redirect.
- Assets: Optimized logo files by introducing small/medium variants and updated favicon/header references to reduce initial load weight.
- SEO/Social: Added Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags to index.html with the production URL (https://soulmatelabs.github.io/couplair-site/).
- UI: Refactored the "Why" section grid to ensure equal-height columns on desktop and enhanced the role card's layout and font size.
- Content: Replaced placeholder citations in the "Why" section with verified research links.
- Maintenance: Upgraded Vite to v7 and opted into React Router v7 future flags for forward compatibility.
- Fix: Added 'pointer-events-auto' to the DownloadModal to ensure interactivity when triggered from the fixed header.
