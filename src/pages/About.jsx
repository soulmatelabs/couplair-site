          At <span className="font-semibold text-primary">Couplair</span>, we don’t think intimacy should feel like a chore on a calendar.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Our journey started with a simple observation: most couples struggle with the "Ask." Direct initiation often carries the weight of potential rejection, leading many to stay silent rather than risk a "no." We set out to build a low-pressure intimacy tool that removes the guesswork from your relationship.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">Our Mission: To Protect the "Yes"</h2>
        
        <p>
          We’ve created a digital space where spontaneity and emotional safety coexist. By using a "double-blind" synchronization method, Couplair ensures that your desires—whether for a quiet night in, a spontaneous date, or physical intimacy—are only revealed when you are both on the same page.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          We aren't just an app; we are a bridge. We help couples bypass the awkwardness and get straight to the connection, fostering a relationship where both partners feel heard, wanted, and perfectly in sync.
