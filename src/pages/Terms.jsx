          <h3>3. SoulMate Labs App Environment & Distribution</h3>
          <h4>3.1 Scope of Services:</h4>
          <p>
            SoulMate Labs provides tools for communication, journaling, social
            organization, and matchmaking.
          </p>
          <h4>3.2 Beta and Experimental Nature:</h4>
          <p>
            You acknowledge that several Services (including but not limited to
            SoulSight, Up4it, and SoulMate) may be in "Beta" or "Early Access"
            stages. These Services are experimental and may contain bugs,
            experience downtime, or undergo significant feature changes
            without notice. Use of Beta Services is at your own risk.
          </p>
          <h4>3.3 Sideloading and Third-Party Distribution:</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>Assumption of Risk:</strong> You acknowledge that Apps may
            be available via direct download (APK/Sideloading). Sideloading
            bypasses standard store security protocols. You engage in
            sideloading at your own exclusive risk.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Security & Updates:</strong> Sideloaded versions do not
              receive automatic updates. It is your sole responsibility to
              manually verify and install the latest versions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Limited Liability:</strong> SoulMate Labs is not liable
              for data breaches, malware, or bugs resulting from the use of
              non-store versions or failure to update.
            </li>
          </ul>
